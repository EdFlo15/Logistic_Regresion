- **Model Training**: Examples of training various machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Methods to evaluate and interpret model performance.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing data and model results.
- **Deployment**: Steps to deploy machine learning models to production.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.4
- Git

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EdFlo15/notebooks.git
    cd notebooks
    ```


2. **Usage:**

    For each project you want to execute, enter the project directory, create a virtual environment, and install the necessary libraries

3. **Set up a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
